Instructions for example setup...

1) Tap "User Preferences".
2) Tap Authorize.
3) Enter username/password information. 
4) Allow app to use Google Drive/Sheets.
5) Tap "View Files" ( All of your spreadsheets should appear).
6) Tap "Add Entries to DB" will take users back to main screen.
7) On main screen, tap the Go and Stop buttons.

8) Please follow format:  
   Your class rosters should be organized via Tab name at the bottom.
   Your Line 1 should be a header with labels "Last Name" (in Box 1A) and "First Name" in Box 1B).
   Obviously, the names should be Last Name First, First Name Last. 

9) If there's any interest in the app, I will change the setup such that it is far more flexible than it currently is. However, I don't see a need to add features yet, when I'm not even sure users will even care.
